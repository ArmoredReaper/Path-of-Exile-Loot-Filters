# Path of Exile 2 Filters

I will (hopefully) upload my custom item filters for Path of Exile 2 in this folder. Might separate them by game version if it is ever needed.

## Catulus' Softcore Filter
A simple generalist filter with a couple of features to ease my trips through the game (I'm a chronic re-roller).

### Features
- Color-coded jewels and league drops (except currency).
- Currency tiered via the in-game Currency Exchange, separated into 4 tiers : Divine, Exalted, Chaos, Bubblegum.
- Basic gear progresssion: hides normal items when entering Cruel, and advanced items when entering maps.
- Flask and waystone progression to hide low-level drops and under-tiered waystones.
- Always shows jewellery to facilitate crafting.
- Highlights salvageable and rare drops.
- Override section allows customizing to a specific build's needs.
